# Ionic concentrations in and around myocytes

People tend to be very sloppy about citing origins for these.
Would like to have a solid source for the main internal and external ones here, eventually.

## Overview

## External sodium

## Internal sodium

## External potassium

Usually taken as 5.4 mM in experiments and models, possibly because this leads to stable experiments (Clerx, 2021).
But evidence in very large cohorts firmly shows average value is lower, and 5.4 mM is often regarded as hyperkalemic (outside of the normal range).
